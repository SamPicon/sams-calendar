            <h2>April 11 - 13</h2>
            <p class="card-text"> I spent these days wandering around Yosemite National Park. Spring is the best season to come. Due to the melting snow, the falls rush like crazy compared to other seasons. I managed to complete some top-rated day hikes, including the Yosemite Upper Falls trail and the Vernal and Nevada Falls trails. Beyond hiking, the park offers breathtaking views—my favorite was the sight of both the lower and upper Yosemite Falls.<br>The park also has a free shuttle bus that takes visitors to various locations, so I used my last full day to explore different parts of the park. I even saw rock climbers scaling El Capitan! <br>I’m really glad I had the chance to visit Yosemite, though it all felt a bit rushed. Next time I go, I hope to stay much longer!</p>
