            <h2>What happened Today?</h2>
            <p class="card-text"> Today, Callaway and I hit the road! After two hours of traffic getting out of Fort Worth, we finally made it to I-20. The sunset was beautiful, and I passed miles of ranch land, cattle, and semi-trucks. Nothing too exciting happened, except for one guy who told me I had “great hair”—then immediately started doing the boogie. He might have been on something. <br>Three hours later, I arrived at my first destination: Walmart! By then, it was dark and cold outside, so I geared up for sleep and called it a night.</p>
