            <h2>What happened today?</h2>
            <p class="card-text">Today I was brainstorming about interior window panels. I want to make them stealthy - from the outside the windows are blacked out preventing any peepers. Apparently, the best option is to use "Reflectix" which is like bubble wrap insulator that has a reflective cover. If I paint one side black, then I'll have a black-out look. Another idea was to use a certain type of plastic that has groves in between itself for insulating properties. </p>
