            <h2>April 14th</h2>
            <p class="card-text"> For my next adventure, I made my way to Sequoia National Park. I managed to snag a last-minute campsite at the edge of a trailhead parking lot — turns out a few others had the same idea.<br>I was surprised to find snow still on the ground, which made for a very cold night. My toes were freezing, but luckily I came prepared — thank you, wool socks.<br>Unfortunately, most of the park was closed, but the trail I had come to see was open. I saw some giants that day.<br>Although my time with the Sequoias was short-lived, I definitely consider it a highlight. Being surrounded by those trees had an indescribable effect on me — maybe I was “one with nature” in that moment.</p>
